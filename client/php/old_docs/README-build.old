PHP Extension for libsapo-broker2

BUILD
run ./build.sh on the deployment system to create the debian package
for the correct php version

requires dh_* tools, php5-dev and libsapo-broker2

NOTE
This tool uses dh-make-pecl, which is unable to read a dependency list and pass it do dpkg,
You will need to manually install the following packages in order to build this pecl extension
	apt-get install dh-make-php php5-dev build-essential
Make sure you build the package using the same php version as your deployment environment to
avoid arch, versioning problems with phpize

There is a generic Linux/amd64/php5 deb package included. It may or may not work on _your_ system :)
