The implementation here is splitted in two sub-projects

 libsapo-broker is a shared library to access the SAPO Broker.
 libsapo-brokerxs-perl is a perl(XS) library that uses libsapo-broker

 sapo-broker-agent is meant as an example application more than
  something really usefull, specially because its features are
  already implemented by the Perl POE client.
