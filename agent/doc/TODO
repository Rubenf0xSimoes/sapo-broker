TODO, TO THINK

1) Difered message publication:
   - Publish a message to be delivered after a given time/date. (header VALID_AFTER?)

2) TTL in Virtual Queues 
   - Set a TTL in subscriptions. TTL is uptaded in each subscription.

3) Rethink delivery strategy for message from queues
   - More event-driven
   - Less thread-driven
   - Or some
