    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>Sapo-Broker is a high performance distributed messaging framework. It can either work as a local daemon that has a SOAP API or embedded within your application. Among other features, it provides minimal administration overhead, Publish-Subscribe and Point-to-Point messaging, guaranteed delivery and wildcard subscriptions. </para>
    <para>Sapo-Broker is written in Java and has client libraries for Java, Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby, .NET, C and Erlang.</para>

      <title>Messaging</title>
      <para>When talking about messaging we are really talking about asynchronous operations. This means that broker clients can register interest in "Destinations"and return immediately, also a client can be notified in an event-driven fashion when something has happened. This allows for a loosely coupled exchange of messages between producers and consumers since they know nothing of each other, they only know about destinations (queues and topics). Immediate benefits of using messaging are:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Fire and Forget: Producers don't wait for consumers, as soon as the broker receives the message they may return immediately.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Scalability: Messages in a single stream can be handled in parallel by many client threads or systems </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Robustness to Change: Applications on heterogeneous platforms communicate and interoperate transparently yet each application operates independently of, and asynchronously with, others. Communicating programs remain separately maintained and individually replaceable.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Time Independence: Neither the message sender nor the message recipient needs to be online at the same time. The Broker queues messages when their recipients are not available. </para>

        <sect4><title><anchor id="Publish-Subscribe"/>Publish-Subscribe</title>
	<para>One message goes to 0-to-many consumers based on the current subscribers, very similar to mailing lists or discussion forums. The producer is decoupled from the consumers, it doesn’t need to know who all the consumers are. Good model for publishing business events. Allows one part of your system to notify anyone else who may be interested in an event.</para></sect4>
        <sect4><title><anchor id="Point-to-Point"/>Point-to-Point</title>
	<para>Queues implement reliable load balancing with optional persistence. Message delivery is load balanced across many consumers, meaning each message goes to exactly one consumer, consumers compete for messages. Messages are only removed from the Queue after the broker receives an acknowledge and if a consumer crashes during the processing of a message it is automatically redelivered to another consumer.</para></sect4>

      <title>Main features overview</title>
      <para>Sapo-Broker supports publish-subscribe and point-to-point communication, as well durable topic subscription. Subscriptions are not hierarchical and may be defined as regular expressions.</para>
      <para>Messages may be encoded in XML or using a binary encoding mechanism. Access control policies can be defined to constrain message production or consumption based in several criteria including role-based authorization. SSL can be configured for further message security. A dropbox functionality is also available. </para>
      <para>Clients libraries are available in a number of languages and platforms such as Java, Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby, .NET, C and Erlang.</para>
      <para>The number of agents constituting a communicating cloud is easily scalable thus providing system scalability and availability.</para>
      <para>Overall configuration is minimum. </para>

    <title>Sapo-Broker Features</title>
    <sect2>
      <title>Supported broker topologies</title>
      <para>Message brokers, depending on specific products, can be configured to implement different topologies, such as hierarchal, network, single broker or mixture of the previous.</para>
      <para>Sapo-Broker can be used as a single instance or in network topology. Although a single agent instance could be used in small working sets, a multiple agent (network) design would better take advantage of Sapo-Broker, namely in system availability and throughput, with client failover and distributed workload, respectively. In networking topologies all agents are interconnected in what is known as agent cloud. For now it not yet possible to communicate between different agent clouds.</para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Configuration</title>
      <para>Sapo-Broker configuration has a two level scope, meaning that some configuration aspects are related to Broker agents and others are global, and, as such, are applicable to all agents in the same cloud.</para>
      <para>Configuration files are XML documents conforming with a provider XML Schema.</para>
      <sect3>
        <title>Global configuration</title>
        <para>There are three main configuration sections in global configuration file: Domain, Messages and Access Control. The later is divided in two parts and is discussed in Access control section [LINK].</para>
        <para>Domain contains the agents composing the broker cloud ,that is, all the interconnected agents through witch client communication occurs. For each agent is defined a name and communication parameters  (IP and TCP port).</para>
        <para>The configuration aspects regarding messages are defined in Messages section. There is possible to define the maximum message size, the maximum number of queues, and topic distinct subscriptions, as well the time each queue message kept without consumers. Once that time ends, the message is deleted. </para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
        <title>Agents configuration</title>
        <para>Agent specific configuration contains all information specific to each agent, as its name open TCP ports, such inter-agent communication port, client TCP, UDP and HTTP port as well as a legacy port through witch clients not supporting the new wire messaging protocol can still communicate. This parameters are defined in "net" section as well as the location of the global configuration file.</para>
        <para>The directory where the queue messages are persisted is specified in "persistency" section. Dropbox functionality is configured in "messaging" section where the watch out directory, check interval, and whether the this feature is enabled or not are defined.</para>
        <para>Another optional section exists witch is related to SSL support. This is discussed in SSL Configuration [LINK].</para>
      </sect3>

      <title>Message Publication and Subscription</title>
      <para>When designing and implementing messaging-based solutions two man paradigms exist: Point-to-Point and Publish-Subscribe. Just like Java Message Service (<ulink url="http://java.sun.com/products/jms/">JMS</ulink>) we use the terms "TOPIC" to refer Publish-Subscribe messaging pattern and "QUEUE" to designate Point-to-Point messaging. Sapo-Broker supports  both of these patterns and adds "VIRTUAL_QUEUE" witch stands somewhere in between.</para>
      <para>A publication, in general terms, contains a Destination Type (TOPIC or QUEUE) witch determines the pattern intended is, and a Destination Name witch may be a TOPIC or QUEUE name. Subscriptions, on the other hand, include a Destination Type, but may also be VIRTUAL_QUEUE, witch means that subscribers desire that some TOPIC publication should be persisted and retrieved like a QUEUE publication; and TOPIC names can referred using a regular expression, not the exact name.</para>
      <sect3>
        <title>Publish-Subscribe</title>
        <para>Messages published to the Destination Type "TOPIC" adhere to the Publish-Subscribe pattern, that is, they are delivered to any consumer subscribed in the published Destination Name. That is, they can be delivered to zero or many consumers, regardless if they are connected to the same agent as the producer or a remote one. If there are no remote clients, the local agent doesn't forward the message.</para>
        <para>Message producers, using this pattern, don't have no know what applications are interested in a particular type of message. Producers just publish events notifying of some notable occurrence and applications subscribed to it based on their needs.</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
        <title>Point-to-Point</title>
        <para>When using Point-to-Point messaging pattern, message delivery is load balanced across many consumers, meaning each message goes to exactly one consumer. Consumers compete for messages and  must acknowledge they successfully process the message. Message producers and consumers may not overlap their existence in time.</para>
        <para>This pattern is most adequate when system work load must be distribute, message processing should be done by only one entity and producers know in advanced that their will message consumers.</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
        <title>Virtual Queues</title>
        <para>Events published as TOPIC messages lack the ability to be persisted and QUEUE messages once consumed by a system, can not be consumed by another, where system means a set a software entities that work collaborative with other software entities with the same system. This means that if there are two systems interested in the same type of information published to queues, the two systems wouldn't received the same messages.</para>
        <para>To overcome these handicaps a Sapo-Broker supports VIRTUAL_QUEUE Destination Type. When clients subscribe to a Virtual Queue a queue is created and all topic messages whose Destination Name match the subscription are stored in the created queue.</para>
        <para>Destination Name subscription of Virtual Queues has the form:</para>
        <para>        [private name]@[topic name subscription pattern]</para>
        <para>An example could be: myVirtualQueue@/topic/.*</para>
        <para>Please note that the private names must be unique across systems (as defined previously) so that the problems with Point-to-Point pattern don't arise.</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
        <title>Message Queues</title>
        <para>Queues implement reliable load balancing with persistence. Messages are only removed from the Queue after the broker receives an acknowledge, so if a consumer crashes during the processing of a message it is automatically redelivered to another consumer. Clients have a limited time to acknowledge message processing during witch the message is guaranteed not be delivered to other client. The first time the message is delivered local consumers have priority.</para>
        <para>This design protects the system, in a broader sense, against client failure but not against agents failure. If a message is delivered to a client and, before client's Acknowledge, the agent fails, the message maybe delivered again. This violates the Point-to-Point pattern premises but in real world scenarios is near impossible to guarantee 100% robustness. Trade-offs considered and having empiric knowledge that this is a very rare case a few mitigation guidelines are offered to overcome the issue, in case that it constitutes a critical problem.</para>
        <sect4>
          <title>Solution 1 – Client persistence</title>
          <para>Clients, once they receive the message may persist it and send the respective Acknowledge with an Action Identifier. If the connection with the agent is lost or an Accept message is not received the message should not be processed and eventually will be delivered again, otherwise the client can process the message. If meanwhile client fails its responsible for, when reactivated, process the locally persisted message.</para>
        </sect4>
        <sect4>
          <title>Solution 2 – Global acknowledge record</title>
          <para>To guarantee that each produced message is processed only once a global acknowledge record may be implemented. After receiving a message, clients query the global acknowledge system to determine if the message was already processed, if not, they process it and afterwards send the due Acknowledge message and inform the global acknowledge system that a given message was already processed. The  last step may be only done if the acknowledge fails.</para>

        <title>Deciding witch pattern to use – a sample</title>
        <para>In order to make the choice of what message pattern to use easier and clarify the previous discussed Destination Type options a sample is provided.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Access Control</title>
      <para>To protect sensitive information Sapo-Broker provides an access control mechanism. Each agent may have a specific security policy or inherit the default (eventually none).</para>
      <para>A security policy is composed by an Access Control List (ACL), which is composed by entries. Each entry has an action (PERMIT or DENY), destination type (TOPIC, QUEUE or VIRTUAL_QUEUE), destination (such as "/topic/foo" or a regular expression) and privilege (READ or WRITE).An entry is also composed by conditions that determine when the ACL entry should be applied have have in consideration factors such client IP address, channel type (SSL or clear channel), client's roles or combinations of the previous.</para>

    <title>Sapo-Broker Messages</title>
    <para>Sapo-Broker makes its asynchronous messaging features available through the exchange of some well-known messages. These messages must be encoded using a supported encoding type and comply to the wire message format as well as the messaging format defined for each message.</para>
    <para>The overall structure of a Sapo-Broker is demonstrated in <xref linkend="Figure-MessageFormat" />. The wire message serves as a transportation medium for the messaging layer message as payload, witch, in cases of message publishing or notification, contains client's data.</para>

        <title>Header</title>
        <para>In a previous, but still supported, version the header was composed by a 32 bits value specifying the payload's length. This is intended to provide temporary retro compatibility but will be made unavailable. Header layout is presented in <xref linkend="Figure-OldHeader" />.</para>

        <para>Currently, the header specifies the payload encoding protocol used (16 bits) as well as it's version (16 bits) and payload length (32 bits). Although the payload length can represent a maximum of 4GB, a message size limit is set at 256KB. Header layout is presented in <xref linkend="Figure-NewHeader" />.</para>

    <title>Error handling</title>
    <para>There are several cases that result in errors. Things such as IO errors, messaging errors or security related errors are likely to occur. In most of the cases a Fault message is sent by the agent to the producer of the message that originated the error. Some errors however do not result in error messages, they are just logged. Examples of this are unknown encoding or version protocol and the reason is simple: If the message encoding or version are unknown there is no way to know how to encode the Fault message.</para>
    <sect2>
      <title>Logging</title>
      <para>Some agent occurrences don't lead to Fault messages, but represent error or waring events. In these cases logging is performed. Internally Sapo-Broker uses Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) (<ulink url="http://www.slf4j.org/">http://www.slf4j.org/</ulink>). </para>

    <title>Access control</title>
    <para>In order to protect sensitive information Sapo-Broker provides an access control mechanism. This mechanism is parameterized by a security policy in the global configuration file, in the element "security-policies". Each agent may have a specific security or it may inherit the default security policy. The default policy is named "default".</para>
    <para>Security policies may be composed hierarchy, which means that a given security policy X can inherit from a policy Y adding or overriding  specific aspects to the policy. These policies may be associated with agents. If no security policy is to be used, then the element "security-policies" should be omitted for performance reasons.</para>
    <para>A security policy is composed by an Access Control List (ACL), which is composed by entries. Each entry has an action (PERMIT or DENY), a destination type (TOPIC, QUEUE or VIRTUAL_QUEUE), a destination (such as "/topic/foo" or a regular expression) and a privilege (READ or WRITE). Destination types and privileges may be declared as lists which makes the ACL entry easier to read and declare. An entry is also composed by conditions that determine when the ACL entry should be applied. Conditions represent a binary evaluation result which determines the application of the related ACL entry. They can be of the following types:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para>ADDRESS – An IPv4 address and mask;</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>ROLE – A text value with the role name;</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>CHANNEL_TYPE – A type of security property (CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY and/or AUTHENTICITY) guaranteed by the transport channel.</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>AND – A composed condition that evaluates to true if all the contained conditions are true;</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>ALWAYS – The ACL entry is always applied.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <sect2>
      <title>Access control evaluation criteria </title>
      <para>Every agent as an associated security policy, except in the case of security policy absence in witch it defaults to "allow everything". In the case of policy inheritance, eventually with multiple degrees, a stack of entries is built with the most specific ACLs at the top and entries inserted by declaration order within each ACL. The result is an ordered entry stack where the most specific/priority come first, so evaluating a client request against the full access control is sequential evaluation of entries. The first entry witch results in a positive evaluation is applied.</para>
      <para>The entry stack is optimized for evaluation, although maintaining the described model. (More on this we I have the time).</para>

      <title>An annotated sample</title>
      <para>In Code 1 a security configuration sample is presented. As said before, this configuration aspect is defined in global configuration file.</para>
      <para>The sample presents a scenario where the default security policy mandates that no client can produce messages to topic or queue whose named begin with "/system/". The default policy also dictates that destination names beginning with "/private/" are forbidden for all clients. These security settings apply to all agents using the default security policy.</para>
      <para>At the bottom of the sample a section (XML element) entitled "agents" is present. Here is the place to associate specific security policies with agents. The sample states that an agent named "agent007" must used the "anotherPolicy" security policy. This policy inherits from the default security, adds some entries to the ACL and in a specific case overrides the default policy. The added entries specify that message production to the queue named "/specialQueue" is denied to all except those clients that simultaneous possess the role "VIP_role" and are using a type of communication channel that offers confidentiality (such as SSL). The declaration details are self-explanatory. </para>

    <title>Authentication extensibility model</title>
    <para>One of the possibilities of Sapo-Broker access control is based in client roles. The roles associated with clients are determined by pluggable components that comply to Sapo-Broker authentication extensibility model. This model defines:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Configuration aspects that lead to component loading and usage;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>A set of classes and interfaces that authentication modules implement and interact with.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>The modules are responsible for validating client credentials, directly or indirectly, and transform them in roles, if there are any associated with the authenticating client.</para>
    <para>In order to support client authentication agents must provide an SSL channel and all role dependent communications (publications, notifications and subscriptions) should happen over a secure channel. This was a design decision. Given that client credentials are critical information they should not  be disclosed. One could argue that once authentication was established it could be used a clear channel, and therefore more efficient. However, the implementation approaches to address that design proved to be insecure or have a great deal of complexity (highly undesirable given the number of supported client libraries). Another reason drove this design: If something is so important that requires users to authenticate themselves and have a specified role, why allow this information to flow in clear? Moreover, the most significant burden of secure communication occurs during handshaking.</para>
    <sect2>
      <title>Configuration</title>
      <para>Authentication modules, also called validation providers, are configured at the global configuration file.  There, are defined the full name of type implementing pt.com.broker.auth.AuthInfoValidator (more on this later) in the element class and some provider specific provider parameters, under provider-params. The class must be in agent's classpath in order to be loaded.</para>
      <para>To each validation parameter must be attributed a globally known name, since it's used by clients to indicate the type of credentials used in Authentication message [link to this message]. For now there are two authentication types defined.</para>

      <para>The initialization method of AuthInfoValidator gives the provider an opportunity to realize any actions  required to properly validate client's authorization information and translate that information in client roles. The ProviderInfo is used to inform the provider what is the name of the authentication type it will be performing, the class name (redundant) and the parameter specified in the configuration file. These arguments are supplied as an XML representation object.</para>
      <para>Validation operation is invoked as a consequence of an authentication message [link to this] which includes information about the user synthesized as an AuthInfo object. This information may contain an user identifier, user roles (which should be validated), an authentication token (such as password or a third party supplied token) and the type of authentication being used. The authentication token is a binary value, so, in case of representing a string such as a password is UTF-8 encoded. In response to an authentication request a result is produced (AuthValidationResult) indicating whether the credentials are valid (a reason for failure should be supplied in case their not) or not, and the list of roles associated with the user in case of valid credentials.</para>

      <title>Implemented authentication modules</title>
      <para>Currently, there are two authenticate modules available. One interacts with Sapo STS and it's used internally; the other was implemented as a proof-of-concept attesting broker authentication extensibility model's flexibility and provides user name-password database authentication.</para>
      <sect3>
        <title>Sapo STS</title>
        <para>Sapo STS authentication module is divided in two parts, one regathering client validation and the other client authentication. Client authentication is the process of obtaining a SapoSTS security token. To obtain this token clients must provide their user name and password. Once obtained, the token is sent to the agent in an authentication message indicating "SapoSTS" as the authentication type. Both clients and agents use client authentication: clients because they need to supply a token to the agent; and agents need to authenticate themselves in order to extract user roles from the clients.</para>
        <para>Client validation, and subsequent roles extraction, is performed by an agent specific module complying to what was described before. In Code 2 a configuration sample is presented. In case the agent is not using SapoSTS validation it can be removed from the configuration file. This validation module specifies three configuration parameters: Sapo STS location and agent's user name and password.</para>
        <para>SapoSTS validation and authentication are available from sapo-broker-validation-saposts.jar and sapo-broker-clientauth-saposts.jar, respectively.</para>

        <title>Database based authentication</title>
        <para>Sapo-Broker users may not have access to Sapo STS, and probably this would be the case, or they may need do provide their own authentication mechanisms. As a proof-of-concept it was implemented an authentication provider supported by a relational database. The tables creation script is presented at Code 3. As shown, salts are not used and users passwords are store in clear, not their hashes. So this may not be very useful in a production environment where the use of secure practices is mandatory.</para>
        <para>When using this authentication method, denoted by "BrokerRolesDB" authentication type, clients provide, as credentials, their user name and password.</para>
        <para>The configuration of this provider, presented in Code 2, takes the driver class to be loaded, which must be in agent's classpath, the connection URL and the credentials to access the database and respective tables. The authentication functionality is provided in sapo-broker-auth-jdbc.jar.</para>

      <title>SSL Configuration</title>
      <para>Sapo-Broker agents use SSL connections as message transport to client authentication messages and to support all communications that require authentication (role based access control). This type of connection is based on asymmetric cryptography operations and X.509 certificates. In order generate your own key pair and X.509 certificates a small tutorial on how to use SUN's keytool (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/solaris/keytool.html) is provided.</para>

        <para>In order to clients trust agents certificates, during SSL handshaking, the agent's public key, through an X.509 certificate must be added to the trusted certificates client store. It can be added to the default truststore, but it's recommended that client applications specifically used a keystore containing the agent's certificate. This is the approach used by the Java client library.</para>
