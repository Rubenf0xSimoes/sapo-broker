sapo Broker is a distributed messaging framework. Among other features, it provides minimal administration overhead, Publish-Subscribe and Point-to-Point messaging, guaranteed delivery and wildcard subscriptions.

sapo Broker is written in Java, but has client libraries for Perl, Python, PHP, .NET, C and quite a few others, and you can talk to it using Thrift, XML or JSON.

To start using sapo Broker take a look at the Quick Start tutorial, and then please read the User Guide for more in depth information.
